                <div>I have been working as a System Administrator since 2018, worked with different customers and different technologies. Last years I worked with Kubernetes and various technologies around its ecosystem. For instance, Docker/Containerd, Helm, Nginx/Traefik as ingresses, VictoriaMetrics Stack, etc. We went through several k8s releases over 200+ clusters in our infrastructure. I'm also pretty good at some services of AWS cloud as EKS, EC2, ALB, IAM, S3.</div>
                <div>I'm interested in improving my development skills, particularly in Golang. It would be nice to work with PostgreSQL again, a couple years ago I was quite good in it.</div>
